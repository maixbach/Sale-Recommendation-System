# Sale-Recommendation-System
**Sale Recommendation System using Machine Learning models to predict the sale of new product launched on E-Commerce**

The need to build a sales recommendation system in e-commerce is driven by the desire to enhance customer experience, increase sales, and optimize marketing strategies. Such a system can provide valuable insights into pricing and quantity of sales for a particular product, helping businesses make informed decisions and drive revenue growth.

Moreover, a sales recommendation system can optimize pricing strategies. By analyzing data on the price and quantity of sales, businesses can identify pricing patterns and trends. This information can then be used to adjust prices accordingly, ensuring competitiveness in the market and maximizing profitability. For instance, if a particular product consistently experiences low sales despite a competitive price, it may indicate the need for a price reduction or a promotional campaign.

Thus, we decide to spend time on this project. Our team has an understanding of e-commerce and business. We are enthusiast in developing  algorithms and machine learning models that can efficiently process large datasets, identify patterns, and provide accurate recommendations. Our team is well-equipped to develop a robust and tailored system that will empower the business to make data-driven decisions and achieve success in the competitive e-commerce landscape.
